Maxime Fays is a research associate at the University of Sheffield. His research interest include signal & image processing applied on time-frequency analysis, with a particuliar focus on signal extraction in low SNR environment through minimal assumptions about signal properties. He leads the project team for 'Long Duration Search' within the LIGO-Burst group which targets minute-long gravitational-wave signals that can potentially be emitted from extreme astrophysical phenomena such as neutron stars or binary black holes.
